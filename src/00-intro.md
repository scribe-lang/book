# Introduction

Welcome to the Scribe reference manual. Using this documentation, you will be able to understand and use the language for developing your own code.

This manual also includes the documentation for standard library, along with usage examples.

## The Language

Scribe is a statically typed, fully compiled programming language that (currently) transpiles to C code, which is used to generate native binaries.

It provides modern features like:
* Compile time code execution
* Generics (templates)
While providing the programmer with absolute control - there is no Garbage Collection, automatic memory management, or a runtime.
In essence, the language can be considered an extension to C, with a different (but coherent) syntax.

Considering its features, Scribe finds most usefulness in areas related to systems software - developing high performance code with minimal memory footprint.

Now let's start with the installation of the Scribe compiler!
