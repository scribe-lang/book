# Introduction

Welcome to the Scribe reference manual. Using this documentation, you will be able to understand and use the language for developing your own code.

## The Language

Scribe is a statically typed, fully compiled programming language that (currently) transpiles to C code, which is used to generate native binaries.

It provides modern features like:
* Compile time code execution
* Generics (templates)
While providing the programmer with absolute control - there is no Garbage Collection, automatic memory management, or a runtime.
In essence, the language can be considered an extension to C, with a different (but coherent) syntax.

Considering its features, Scribe finds most usefulness in areas related to systems software - developing high performance code with minimal memory footprint.

## Notes

This guide will also include the standard library with usage examples.

## Next

Let's start with the installation of the Scribe compiler.
