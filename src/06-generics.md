# Generics

Generics, also known as **templates**, are special structures and functions which contain one or more variables with placeholder types.
These placeholder types are replaced by actual types when the generic structure/function is created/used.

In modern programming, generics are one of the most useful features as they allow a programmer to write "generic code" which can be used with different types by replacing the placeholders.

Generics are the reason why data structures like `vectors` (dynamically sized arrays), `maps` (dictionaries), etc. are available in standard libraries of languages like C++.
Since they use generic datatypes, they can work with any actual type the programmer requires.
